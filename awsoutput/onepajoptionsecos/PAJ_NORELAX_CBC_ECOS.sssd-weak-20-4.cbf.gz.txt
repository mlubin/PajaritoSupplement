WARNING: Solver does not appear to support adding constraints to an existing model. Hot-start is disabled.
WARNING: If matrix A has nonzero entries smaller than zero tolerance, performance may be improved by fixing these values to zero
WARNING: Not solving the conic continuous relaxation problem; Pajarito may return status :MIPFailure if the outer approximation MIP is unbounded
