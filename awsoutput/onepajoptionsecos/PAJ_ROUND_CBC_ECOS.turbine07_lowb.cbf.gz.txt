WARNING: Solver does not appear to support adding constraints to an existing model. Hot-start is disabled.
WARNING: If matrix A has nonzero entries smaller than zero tolerance, performance may be improved by fixing these values to zero
WARNING: Integer solutions will be rounded: if this seems to cause numerical challenges, change round_mip_sols option
